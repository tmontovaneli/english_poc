# Personal Pronouns

In English, personal pronouns change their form based on their position in a sentence. We categorize them into two main groups: **Subject Pronouns** and **Object Pronouns**.

### Subject Pronouns (The "Doers")
These pronouns represent the person or thing performing the action. They almost always appear **before** the verb.
* **Example:** "*I* study English." (**I** am doing the action).


### Object Pronouns (The "Receivers")
These pronouns receive the action of the verb or follow a preposition (like *with, for, to, at*). They usually appear **after** the verb.
* **Example:** "The teacher helps *me*." (**me** is receiving the help).

## Key Takeaways for Portuguese Speakers

* **No "Hidden" Subjects:** Unlike Portuguese, where you can say *"Sou desenvolvedor,"* in English, you **must** use the Subject Pronoun: *"I am a developer."*
* **The "It" Rule:** We use **It** for objects, animals, and abstract concepts (like the weather or time).
* **The "Preposition" Rule:** After words like *with* or *for*, always use the Object form.
    * ✅ **Correct:** "Come with **me**."
    * ❌ **Incorrect:** "Come with *I*."
    * ❌ **Incorrect:** "My brother and *me* played video game."
    * ✅ **Correct:** "My brother and **I** played video game."

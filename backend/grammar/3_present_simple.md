## 3. Verb to be (Present Simple)

The verb **to be** is the most important verb in English. It describes a **state of being** (who someone is) or a **location** (where someone is).

In Portuguese, you have two different verbs: *ser* and *estar*. In English, we use only one:
* **I am Brazilian.** (*Eu sou brasileiro.*)
* **I am at home.** (*Eu estou em casa.*)



| Personal Pronoun | Verb "To Be" | Example Sentence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** (Eu) | **am** | I am a developer. |
| **You** (Você/Vocês) | **are** | You are very smart. |
| **He** (Ele) | **is** | He is at the office. |
| **She** (Ela) | **is** | She is my teacher. |
| **It** (Isto/Aquilo) | **is** | It is a great game. |
| **We** (Nós) | **are** | We are learning English. |
| **They** (Eles/Elas) | **are** | They are from Canada. |

### 1. The Negative Form
To make a sentence negative, we simply add **not** after the verb "to be" ($am/is/are$).

**Structure:** Subject + Verb to be + **not** + Complement.  
**Example:** "I **am not** a doctor." / "They **are not** tired."

> **Teacher's Tip:** In conversation, we usually use contractions like **isn't** (*is not*) and **aren't** (*are not*). However, "**am not**" does not have a standard contraction like "amn't"—we just say "**I'm not**."

### 2. The Interrogative Form (Questions)
To ask a question, we use **inversion**. This means the verb "to be" moves to the very beginning of the sentence, before the subject.

**Structure:** Verb to be + Subject + Complement + **?** **Example:** "**Is** she a developer?" / "**Are** they from Brazil?"



| Positive | Negative | Interrogative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| I am | I am not | Am I? |
| You are | You are not | Are you? |
| He/She/It is | He/She/It is not | Is he/she/it? |
| We/They are | We/They are not | Are we/they? |

### Common Mistake for Brazilians
In Portuguese, you might say *"Você é programador?"* with just a rising tone. In English, your students must remember to **flip** the words: **"Are you a programmer?"** If they forget the flip, they will sound like they are making a statement rather than asking a question.

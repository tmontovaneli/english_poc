# Possessive Adjectives and Pronouns

In English, possessive adjectives and pronouns are used to show ownership or possession. They are used to describe a noun or a noun phrase.

## Possessive Adjectives

A **possessive adjective** is used to describe a noun. It must always be followed by the noun it possesses. It tells us "whose" something is.

* **Function:** It acts like an adjective (modifying a noun).
* **Formula:** `Possessive Adjective + Noun`
* **Examples:**
    * "This is **my** computer."
    * "Is that **your** car?"
    * "We like **their** new office."

## Possessive Pronouns

A **possessive pronoun** is used to replace a noun or a noun phrase. You use these when the person you are talking to already knows what object you are referring to, so you don't have to repeat the noun.

* **Function:** It acts like a noun (it stands alone).
* **Formula:** `Possessive Pronoun` (No noun follows)
* **Examples:**
    * "The computer is **mine**." (Instead of saying "my computer")
    * "That car is **yours**."
    * "The office is **theirs**."
